# EPD154
Light weight library for Waveshare 1.54B e-paper display (Black and Red) to support Fonts.

This library is created from the original EPD154B library that can be downloaded from waveshare website. I realized the original library does not have any support for Fonts when used with Arduino UNO and other libraries that I found online fill the entire memory of UNO leaving no room for other codes. So, I decided to go to the roots and create my own version of the library this is light (takes about 25% memory) and allows for using custom made Fonts.
